# Southern Code Challenge

## Using React, build an app that:

- ✅ Connects to the NASA API (NASA Open APIs):
- ✅ Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint
- ✅ Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit)
- ✅ The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)
- ✅ Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera
- ❌ By default it shows the latest photos for current day
- ✅ Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)
- ✅ Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890)

### Optional:

- ❌ Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted)
- ❌ A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
- ✅ You can (and will get extra points) use NextJS to develop your app.
- ✅ We do care about the UX design, a nicely styled app would get extra points :D
- ✅ Please use a linter!
